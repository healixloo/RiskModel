Readme:

In this folder contained two subfolders and five scripts, all were coded by Perl.

The folder "input" contained the input files for the scripts, while the foler "output" contained the files that are generated by the scripts.

1. The script "merge.pl" was used to merge FPKM of each sample in each file into one file of FPK matrix.
   Usage: put this script in the folder which contained the downloaded FPKM files of each sample, and run as "perl merge.pl".
   Input: FPKM files.
   Output: "mRNAmatrix.txt" and the number of normal samples and tumor samples.
2. The script "symbol.pl" was applied to transfer the gene ID from ensembl transcript to symbol gene name.
   Usage: put this script in the working folder which contained the input files and run as "perl symbol.pl".
   Input: file "human.gtf" containing the corresponding relationship between Ensembl transcripts and the names of Symbol genes, file "mRNAmatrix.txt" containing the expression value of all samples.
   Output: "symbol.txt".
3. The script "step4pl_moduleGene_mergeExpTime.pl" was used to generate "expTime" which contained the gene expression and information of survival time/state.
   Usage: put this script in the working folder which contained the input files and run as "perl step4pl_moduleGene_mergeExpTime.pl".
   Input:  file "time.txt" contained the follow-up clinical information of survival time/state,  file "moduleGeneExp.txt" contained expression value of risk genes.
   Output: file "expTime.txt" contained both expression and survival time/state.
4. The script "step10pl_moduleGene.prepareIndep.pl" was used to generate file containing both clinical information and risk score as input for independent-factor analysis.
   Usage: put this script in the working folder which contained the input files and run as "perl step10pl_moduleGene.prepareIndep.pl"
   Input: file "clinical.txt" contained clinical information, file "risk.txt" contained the calculated risk score by the Cox model
   Output: file "indepInput.txt" contained the merged clinical information and risk score.
5. The script "step12pl_moduleGene.mergeClinical.pl" was used to generate the file containing both clinical information and expression of risk genes.
   Usage: put this script in the working folder which contained the input files and run as "perl step12pl_moduleGene.mergeClinical.pl"
   Input: file "clinical2.txt" contained selected clinical information, file "risk.txt" contained the calculated risk score by the Cox model and expression of risk genes.
   Output: file "moduleClinical.txt" contained both clinical information, risk genes' expression and risk score.
